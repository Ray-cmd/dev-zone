# Types and grammar

## The basics of language

Javascript use a random mix of other langage for it syntaxe. For exemple C, C++, Java, Python, Perl, Awk, ...

JavaSciprt is case sensitive and use all the unicode charactere. For exemple, *früh* is a valide name.

```js
var früh = "toto"
typeof Früh // undefined because JS is case sensitive
```

If we put one statement per line, we don't need to put a semicolon. And if we want to put several statements per line, we have to put it. It is good practice to put a semicolon at the end of each statement to keep the code clear and to avoid side effects.

## Comments

The syntaxe for the comments is the same as C++ :

```js
// a one-line comment

/*
    a comment block
*/
```
