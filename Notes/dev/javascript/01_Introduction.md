# Javascript

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to trace my learning of *JavaScript*. I learned the basics a long time ago in order to make my websites dynamic with *xHTML4* and *CSS2*. Since then, the language has evolved a lot and in order to keep myself updated, I chose to start again with the basics and to document it.

Eventually, this document should be a memory aid and a collection where I could store all the knowledge I have accumulated.
